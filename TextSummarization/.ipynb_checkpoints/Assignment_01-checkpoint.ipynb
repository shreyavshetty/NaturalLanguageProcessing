      "The venue was so outdated the only good thing were the flour tortillasFirst of all to those calling this neighborhood a ghetto its not ,it is a barrio phoenix original barrio,and it is home to the oldest Mexican street gang which leads to the start of my review,yes Carolinas is a hole in the wall restaurant which i choose to order and dash i wont eat there,for some reason the locals will not mess with you or your car so you are safe  being there.the place is a bit on the dirty side, but damn it they have the best tortillas and green Chile burritos,their chorrizo is all right but not worth the price.Once upon a time their burritos where huge and full of meat but it seems since Carolina (respectfully)passed away her children have become stingy with the meat.Every chance i get when coming home from the east valley i stop there,but i usually go to the Peoria location.I used Yelp to search for good Mexican food in Phoenix - after a string of disappointing Mexican experiences in Tucscon.I really want another Carolina taco.Rolled in here for Lizunch today and the food was okizay, got the Bean Burro enchilada stizyle and must say the Tortilla was the best pizart, but I've had better Mexican food in Scottsdizale.I have to say, as a native Mexican and as an avid conoisseur of REAL Mexican food, Carolina's comes extremely close to the real thing.Stop reading this and go, NOW.Good food,I just wish they would do some remodeling of there restroom, as long as this place has been there and as well as it has established customers the customers deserve a decent restroom to use and upgrading the establishment however its clean and good Mexican food.I will go back never the lessGo here if you want old-school Mexican Food.I guess to each his own but my Idea of good Mexican is not soggy tortillas, food that tastes like cumin a trashy dump that is not clean, there is no way you can clean a place like this they make enough money to at least put in a decent floor, but trust me you eat what you see.Definite dive but the food was good.Again, it was good food but if someone served you this food and made no mention of Carolina's, you wouldn't be able to distinguish this food from several dozen Mexican style pseudo fast food eateries.You will be the perfect guest if you take tortillas on the plane to your host...and you will be the envy of the flight if you have lunch to go.1 - There were bars on the windows\n",
      "2 - The inside smelled like urine\n",
      "3 - A homeless guy came in and tried to steal my food\n",
      "\n",
      "I can get past the ambiance, a lot of hole in the wall places actually have good food.Overall, the prices at Carolina's were great, the food was very good, and we will be stopping back on our next trip up to Phoenix.The place is a dive but the food is very good.I dont know...I feel like if they did it may get even more popular and then Id be annoyed.Quick, fast and cheap.. and decent food for the price, service and ambiance oopsI mean a no ambiance but hey they have the best tortillas in town and those hole in the wall places have the best food sometimes...** Good thing I didn't get a cockroach in my burrito, like the other lady, that would have been so terrible!Good place, good food, but as the others have said the seating area could use some more attention and los banos need a heavy dose of TLC.It's cheap, delicious and very satisfying.Looks suspect however had good reviews so we are checking it out... Food was subpar there is a reason why the food is cheap....Quite simply, some of the most authentic, straight-forward Mexican food I've ever had.\n"
